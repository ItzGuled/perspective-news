# Perspective News

## Description
The goal of this application is to provide users with many different news sources that offer different perspectives regarding the same topic. We've noticed that depending on which news source you are reading, information can be relayed very differently, so it would be nice to see comparisons in one search.

## User Story
```
AS a consumer of the news
I WANT to be presented with different news sources
SO THAT I can gather a more well-rounded view of the topic
```
